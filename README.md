This extension uses Manifest v2 which is [no longer supported by Google Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/) and most other chromium based browsers. I used v2 since Firefox is yet to support Manifest v3 so  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Development

Install the dependencies

```
yarn
```

To build the final extension

```
yarn build
```

During development, to watch for file changes

```
yarn watch
```
